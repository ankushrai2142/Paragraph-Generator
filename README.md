# Paragraph-Generator
Project
Create a lorem-ipsum generator, as shown in the below Live-preview. There should be a range slider and a number text field in it. Both should be connected, meaning if I increase the range slider then the number should also increase and vice-versa. The range slider should be from 1 to 10 and also limit the number field from 1 to 10.

When you click the Generate button, it should generate that many paragraphs of lorem ipsum or similar text.
